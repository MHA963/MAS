## Problem Overview

We selected **Task B**: implement and study a MARL technique (Regret Matching) in the **Level‑Based Foraging** world using **ir-sim**, scale the number of agents, and reflect on performance. We focus on:

- How regret-matching agents coordinate to collect rewards.
- How collision avoidance and parameter choices affect efficiency and fairness.
- How performance scales with **5, 10, and 20 agents**.

---

## System Setup

- **Simulator:** ir-sim
- **Environment:** 20×20 continuous world, fixed reward patches (subset selection for smaller agent counts)
- **Robots:** differential-drive, 2D LIDAR
- **Key files:**  
  - `rm.py`: regret-matching logic, reward shaping, epsilon decay, global reward ledger, patch subset selection.
  - `collision_avoidance.py`: TTC-based speed limiting and escape turns.
  - `plot1.py`: CSV ingestion, mean/std plots, top-k agent comparisons.
  - `test.yaml`, `test_5.yaml`, `test_10.yaml`: configs for 20/5/10 agents.
  - `test.py`, `test_5.py`, `test_10.py`: experiment drivers with early-stop on full collection.

---

## Method: Regret Matching (RM) + Collision Avoidance

- **State abstraction:** discretize (x, y) into grid cells (0.5 m).
- **Actions (5):** forward, fwd+left, fwd+right, rotate left, rotate right.
- **Policy:** sample actions ∝ positive regrets + ε-greedy exploration (ε decays from 0.30 → 0.05 over 800 steps).
- **Rewards:**
  - (+) patch collection (once per patch, enforced by global ledger)
  - (−) step penalty
  - (+) shaping for reducing distance to nearest reward
  - (−) penalty for excessive rotation/standing still

- **Collision avoidance:** TTC-based forward speed limiting; escape turn if TTC < threshold; hysteresis lock to keep turning until safe.
- **Early termination:** stop episode when all rewards collected.

---

## Experiments

### Scenarios
- **Agent counts:** 5, 10, 20.
- **Reward subsets:**  
  - 20 agents: full canonical list (17 patches).  
  - 5 agents: 4 patches (0.8×agents, rounded) from the canonical list via `set_reward_patches`; random seed = 42; using random 4 indices of the canonical list.  
  - 10 agents: 8 patches (0.8×agents, rounded) from the canonical list via `set_reward_patches`; random seed = 42; using random 8 indices of the canonical list.  
- **Configs:** `vel_max = [1.0, 2.0]` for 5/10; `vel_max = [1.0, 3.5]` for 20; `COLLECT_RADIUS = 0.4`.  

### Metrics
- Episode return (per agent)
- Rewards collected (count, fairness)
- Steps to first/last collection; `since_last_collect`
- Fraction of rewards collected; time to full clearance
- Action distribution; regret statistics

### Runs (representative, latest code)
- 5 agents: 4 patches; ε-decay on; `vel_max=[1.0, 2.0]`.
- 10 agents: 8 patches; ε-decay on; `vel_max=[1.0, 2.0]`.
- 20 agents: 17 patches; `vel_max=[1.0, 3.5]`.

## Results (Qualitative + Quantitative Highlights)

### Overall
- **Faster convergence** after ledger/ε-decay/rotation-penalty fixes.
- **Collision avoidance** keeps wasted steps low; agents “fan out” early.
- **Fairness improved** duplicate collections eliminated

### 5‑Agent Results (0.8× patches from canonical list)
[Results (5 agents)](https://github.com/Valquaresma03/MAS/tree/main/results_5agents)

[Plots (5 agents)](https://github.com/Valquaresma03/MAS/tree/main/results_5agents/plots)

- **Outcome:** All 4 patches collected; early stop at **step 2237** (`Collected: 4/4`).  

- **Behavior:** Travel-heavy early phase; action mix ~30% forward, ~25% arcs, ~15% turns. No duplicate collections; TTC prevents stalls.  

- **Takeaway:** Small team is travel-limited; slower ε decay or modest `vel_max` bump can reduce time-to-first-pickup.

### 10‑Agent Results (0.8× patches from canonical list)
[Results (10 agents)](https://github.com/Valquaresma03/MAS/tree/main/results_10agents)

[Plots (10 agents)](https://github.com/Valquaresma03/MAS/tree/main/results_10agents/plots)


- **Outcome:** All 8 patches collected; early stop at **step 1959** (`Collected: 8/8`). 
- **Behavior:** 4/10 agents collected (2, 6, 7, 9); the others never picked up. Policy settles on forward/arcs; pure rotations ~7–11%.
- **Collections:** Few pickup events concentrated in those 4 agents; returns spike at pickups and stay negative for the rest. `dmin` drops near pickups then rises; non-collectors see `dmin` grow steadily.
- **Takeaway:** Exploration decays too fast (ε→0.05 by ~800 steps), freezing agents that didn’t find a patch early. Mitigate by prolonging/raising ε and/or removing the 0.8 patch scaling to increase collection signals.

### 20‑Agent Results (17 patches, full list)
[Results (20 agents)](https://github.com/Valquaresma03/MAS/tree/main/results_20agents)

[Plots (20 agents)](https://github.com/Valquaresma03/MAS/tree/main/results_20agents/plots)

- **Outcome:** All 17 patches collected; early stop at **step 1365** (`Collected: 17/17`).  
- **Behavior:** Highest throughput; low `since_last_collect`; congestion managed by TTC + escape turns. Multiple agents collected (e.g., agents 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 picked up at least one patch), while a few remained non-collectors but still contributed to coverage and blocking avoidance.  
- **Takeaway:** Best overall speed; TTC keeps dense traffic flowing.

### Scaling Summary 
| Agents | Patches used (rule) | Collected fraction | Steps to full collect | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| 5      | 4 (0.8×agents)      | 1.00               | 2237                  | Travel-limited; completion achieved |
| 10     | 8 (0.8×agents)      | 1.00               | 1959                  | Faster coverage; no congestion issues observed |
| 20     | 17 (full list)      | 1.00               | 1365                  | Fastest overall; TTC mitigates congestion |


### Parameter Effects
- **ε-decay:** High initial ε accelerates discovery; too-early low ε risks stalls.  
- **Vel_max / COLLECT_RADIUS:** Slightly higher values can help both dense and small teams; tune per scenario.

### Behavioral Observations
- Agents self-assign “territories” without communication.
- Escape turns reduce deadlocks at intersections.
- With fewer agents (5), coverage holes appear unless ε stays higher for longer.

---

## Why 5-Agents Can Feel Slower
- Lower natural coverage; each agent travels more.  
- Fewer patches (0.8×agents) still give fewer shaping signals; if ε decays too early, distant patches stay unvisited.  
- Mitigations: slower ε decay for small teams, modest `vel_max` bump, or slightly fewer patches if needed.
---

### Summary of the plots:
- The script ingests `rm_metrics_agent_*.csv` and produces figures for quick analysis: mean ± std across agents and top‑5 curves per metric (returns, dmin, collected, regrets, action probabilities).
- Outputs are saved per run under `results_*/plots/mean_std/` and `results_*/plots/top5/`.

## Discussion

- RM works well without communication; collision avoidance plus shaping yields robust decentralized policies.
- ε-decay and α sweeps expose clear trade-offs between speed, fairness, and total return.
- Scaling: congestion at 20 agents is manageable; at 5 agents, exploration dominates—tune ε and speed/radius accordingly.
- Limitations: no explicit coordination/role assignment; sensitivity to initial seeding; potential congestion on very tight maps.
- Future work: heterogeneous ε per agent, lightweight signaling or region auctioning, adaptive state abstraction (clustering).

---

## Conclusion

- **Regret Matching + TTC collision avoidance** delivers fast, fair, and scalable foraging in LBF.
- Code fixes (global ledger), ε-decay, and shaping markedly improved convergence and fairness.
- Systematic parameter sweeps (ε, agent count) provided insight and reproducibility for the assignment goals.
